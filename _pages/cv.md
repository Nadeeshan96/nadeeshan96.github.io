# Projects {#projects}

__Human-Motion Recognition using Micro-Doppler Signatures__
* This project is all about the design and implementation of an end-to-end continuous wave Doppler radar system to 
recognize human motions in real time using micro-Doppler signatures. To this end, we designed and implemented 
rectangular microstrip antennas operating at 2.45 GHz in the ISM band, a radio frequency (RF) circuit for 
coherent detection using homodyne architecture, and a baseband circuit for sending data to the computer, in a 
printed circuit board (PCB). We also developed a software to recognize nine human motion classes namely jumping 
jacks, boxing, running, crawling, walking with a stick, walking, boxing walk, jumping, and sitting, using signal 
processing and deep learning in real time. In comparison to the visual perception of the human body motion, 
micro-Doppler signatures are not affected by distance, variations in lighting, deformation of clothing, and 
occlusions on the appearance of human body segments. Hence, the outcome of this project is vital for various 
kinds of practical scenarios like human vital signs detection, fall detection, gait analysis, human behavior 
monitoring, and to design touchless systems using hand gesture recognition.

__Multi-Beam Wideband Transmit Beamforming using 2-D Sparse FIR Trapezoidal Filters__ [[paper]](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9268/14/2/26)
* Research project supervised by Dr. Chamira Edussooriya, Dr. Chamith Wijenayake and Prof. Arjuna Madanayake

__Localization using Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) Beaconing using an ESP32 and
machine learning__
* BLE beacon data were collected using MQTT protocol. This
imbalanced dataset was preprocessed and used to train few classifiers such as random forest,
gradient boosted decision trees, KNN, and SVM. Ensemble of these classifiers were used to obtain
higher accuracy. Ultimately ESP32’s location could be displayed in real-time in Node-RED and in an Android mobile
application. [[report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qZMKPedrl6F3G2sIx3FVX-d4j3eXiBvl/view)

__Design of a Mobile App to Detect Types of Medicine using Deep Learning and Android Studio__
* Used Transfer Learning to retrain the MobileNet Convolutional Neural Network
and used TensorFlow Lite to deploy it in the mobile phone. Presented to the Brainstorm 2018
competition and got a merit award.
