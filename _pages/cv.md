# Publications {#publications}
___

__N. Dissanayake__, C. U. S. Edussooriya, C. Wijenayake and A. Madanayake, "__Multi-
Beam Wideband Transmit Beamforming using 2-D Sparse FIR Trapezoidal Filters__," under review in IEEE 
Transactions on Antennas and Propagation
  * Applied the knowledge of convex optimization, digital filters, and
  antenna theory. Used MATLAB, CVX toolbox, Python for multi-dimensional signal processing and constrained
  optimization. Used the CST Studio Suite for the creation and simulation of antenna array system.

D. Pakiyarajah, __N. D. K. Dissanayake__, C. U. S. Edussooriya, C. Wijenayake and A. Madanayake,
"__Weighted Least-Squares Design of 2-D IIR Filters with Arbitrary Frequency Response using Iterative Second-
Order Cone Programming__," 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), Austin, TX, USA,
2022, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937617.

[[tutorial]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E7M5ctkxV-C4oUsuvWN3gpyVQYP-Xh_N/view)
  * Converted the non-convex optimization problem into an iterative SOCP problem,
which is then solved using MATLAB and CVX toolbox.

D. Wijesundera, __N. Dissanayake__, A. Prakash, T. Srikanthan and D. Anhettigama, "__Dependency-Aware
Clustering for Variable-Grained Hardware-Software Partitioning__," 2019 International Conference on Field-
Programmable Technology (ICFPT), Tianjin, China, 2019, pp. 411-414, doi: 10.1109/ICFPT47387.2019.00080.
[[pdf]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vtNaD3MGFhkxNma12EH2frdmsXDiAF6v/view)
  * Presented an algorithm for efficient hardware (HW) – software (SW) partitioning of C applications on FPGAs.

# Work Experience {#work}
___

__Software Engineer__ at [WSO2](https://wso2.com/) _(May 2021 - present)_
* Member of the [Ballerina programming language](https://ballerina.io/) team.
Responsible mainly for the Ballerina runtime, including but not limited to scheduling, type checking, APIs,
JVM bytecode generation, intermediate representation (IR) optimization, and performance.

__Research Assistant__ at Hardware and Embedded Systems Lab (HESL), Nanyang Technological University,
Singapore (2020 QS World University Ranking - 11) _(Jun 2019 - Dec 2019)_
* 6 months research internship on the project "__Intelligent Tool for Design Exploration and Customization of FPGA based CSoC Platforms__"
* Presented an algorithm for efficient hardware (HW) – software (SW) partitioning of C applications on FPGAs.
Estimated the HW, SW performance on functional level for different FPGA device families. Automated the
generation of interfaces, C, Verilog code for the HW-SW partitioned application. Used C, Verilog, Python, LLVM, LegUp HLS
* Supervisors: Dr. Deshya Wijesundera, Prof. Alok Prakash, Prof. Thambipillai Srikanthan
